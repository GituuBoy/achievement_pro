# CSS Hot-Fix Plan

This plan outlines the steps to resolve the CSS import errors that are currently preventing the application from running correctly.

## Problem Analysis

The Vite development server is reporting two main errors related to the `index.css` file:
1.  **`@import` Order:** The `@import 'konsta/css';` statement is positioned before the `@tailwind` directives, which violates PostCSS processing rules.
2.  **Missing Specifier:** The import path `konsta/css` is not resolving correctly, indicating that the path is either incomplete or incorrect.

## Proposed Solution

To fix these issues, the following changes will be made to `achievement-project/src/index.css`:

1.  **Reorder Imports:** The `@tailwind` directives will be moved to the top of the file to ensure they are processed first.
2.  **Correct Konsta UI Path:** The import path for Konsta UI will be updated to the correct specifier, which is `konsta/react/konsta.css`.

### `index.css` Changes

```diff
- @import 'konsta/css';
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
+ @import 'konsta/react/konsta.css';

  body {
    background-color: #f7f8fa;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
    -moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
  }
```

## Implementation Steps

1.  Apply the changes to `achievement-project/src/index.css`.
2.  Restart the development server to confirm the fix.

This plan will ensure that the CSS is processed correctly and the application can run without any import-related errors.
