# Main Entry Point

This document describes the main entry point of the React application.

## `main.tsx`

*   **Location:** [`src/main.tsx`](achievement-project/src/main.tsx)
*   **Description:** This file is the primary entry point for the React application. It's responsible for rendering the root React component (`App`) into the DOM.
*   **Purpose:** To initialize the React application and connect it to the HTML document.

### Key Functionality

*   **`import { StrictMode } from 'react'`**: Imports React's `StrictMode` component, which helps identify potential problems in an application by activating additional checks and warnings for its descendants.
*   **`import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'`**: Imports `createRoot` from `react-dom/client`, the modern way to hydrate a React application to the DOM.
*   **`import './index.css'`**: Imports the global CSS file, which includes Tailwind CSS directives and custom body styles.
*   **`import App from './App.tsx'`**: Imports the root `App` component of the application.
*   **`createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(...)`**: This line renders the `App` component within `StrictMode` into the HTML element with the ID `root`. The `!` asserts that `document.getElementById('root')` will not be null, which is common in TypeScript React setups.

*   **Code Snippet:**
    ```tsx
    import { StrictMode } from 'react'
    import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
    import './index.css'
    import App from './App.tsx'

    createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
      <StrictMode>
        <App />
      </StrictMode>,
    )
