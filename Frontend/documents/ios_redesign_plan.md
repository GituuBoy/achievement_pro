# 1. UI/UX Overhaul Plan: iOS-Inspired Redesign for Students

*   **Objective:** To create a visually appealing, intuitive, and engaging user experience for students, drawing inspiration from modern iOS design trends while maintaining a unique brand identity.

*   **Target Audience:** Students (implying a need for a clean, vibrant, and easy-to-navigate interface).

# 2. Proposed UI Component Library

*   I recommend using **Konsta UI**, a mobile-first component library built with Tailwind CSS. It offers a pixel-perfect, native-like experience for iOS and Android, with a high degree of customization that will allow us to create a unique look and feel.

# 3. Design and Theming

*   **Color Palette:** We will introduce a fresh, energetic color palette that resonates with students. This will include a primary color for interactive elements, a secondary color for accents, and a range of neutral tones for text and backgrounds.

*   **Typography:** We will select a clean, legible, and modern font pairing that enhances readability and aligns with the overall aesthetic.

*   **Iconography:** We will use a consistent set of icons that are easily recognizable and contribute to a cohesive visual language.

# 4. Component-Level Redesign

*   We will systematically redesign the existing components, such as buttons, text inputs, and step indicators, to align with the new design system. This will involve updating their styles, animations, and interactions to create a more polished and responsive feel.

# 5. Screen-Level Redesign

*   **Welcome Screen:** We will redesign the welcome screen to be more visually engaging, with a focus on clear calls-to-action and a more dynamic layout.

*   **Onboarding Flow:** We will streamline the onboarding process, making it more intuitive and visually appealing. This will include redesigning the project name screen and other onboarding steps to create a seamless user journey.

# 6. Implementation Plan

*   **Phase 1: Setup and Theming**
    *   Install and configure Konsta UI.
    *   Define the new color palette, typography, and iconography in the Tailwind CSS configuration.

*   **Phase 2: Component Refactoring**
    *   Update the existing components to use the new design system and Konsta UI components.

*   **Phase 3: Screen Redesign**
    *   Implement the new designs for the welcome screen and onboarding flow.
