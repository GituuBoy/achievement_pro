# Maintainability

This document outlines the strategies and practices to ensure the maintainability of the Achievement Project application.

## Overview

Maintainability refers to the ease with which the application can be understood, modified, and extended. High maintainability reduces the cost and effort of future development and bug fixing.

## Strategies for Maintainability

*   **Clear Folder Structure:** Adherence to the defined architecture-aligned folder structure for logical organization of code.
*   **Consistent Coding Standards:** Following ESLint rules and a consistent code style (e.g., Prettier) to ensure uniformity across the codebase.
*   **Modular Design:** Breaking down features into small, independent, and reusable components and modules.
*   **Readable Code:** Writing self-documenting code, using meaningful variable and function names, and adding comments where necessary.
*   **Documentation:** Maintaining up-to-date and comprehensive documentation for components, modules, APIs, and overall architecture.
*   **Testing:** Implementing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Dependency Management:** Regularly updating dependencies and removing unused ones to prevent technical debt and security vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conducting thorough code reviews to ensure quality, consistency, and knowledge sharing.
*   **Error Handling:** Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage unexpected situations and provide clear feedback.

## Tools and Practices

*   **ESLint:** For enforcing code quality and style.
*   **Prettier:** For automated code formatting.
*   **Git:** For version control and tracking changes.
*   **JSDoc/TSDoc:** For inline code documentation (if TypeScript is extensively used).
