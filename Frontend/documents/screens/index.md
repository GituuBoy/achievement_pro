# Screens

This document provides an overview of the various screens (views) within the Achievement Project application. Each screen is responsible for presenting specific UI and user interactions.

## Organization

Screens are typically organized into subdirectories based on their functional area (e.g., `onboarding`, `dashboard`).

## Available Screens

### Onboarding

The `onboarding` directory contains screens related to the initial user setup and project creation process.

*   **ProjectNameScreen**: The first step of the onboarding flow, allowing users to input their project name.
