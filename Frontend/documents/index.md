```

*   **`/assets`**: Contains static assets like images.
*   **`/components`**: Houses reusable UI components, with a `/common` subfolder for widely used components.
*   **`/screens`**: Contains top-level components that represent different views or pages of the application.
*   **`/store`**: Manages application state using Redux Toolkit, with `/slices` for individual state modules.
*   **`App.jsx`**: The main application component.
*   **`index.css`**: Global styles, including Tailwind CSS directives.
*   **`main.jsx`**: The entry point of the React application.

## Components

This section will detail the various components used throughout the application, categorized by their function and reusability.
