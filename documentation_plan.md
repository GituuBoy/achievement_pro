# Documentation Plan

This document outlines the plan for creating comprehensive documentation for the application. The goal is to produce clear, concise, and well-structured documentation that is easy for developers to use and maintain.

## 1. Documentation Structure

The documentation will be organized into the following sections, each in its own file within a `docs/` directory:

-   `docs/01-introduction.md`: A high-level overview of the application, its purpose, and its intended audience.
-   `docs/02-getting-started.md`: Instructions for setting up the development environment, installing dependencies, and running the application locally.
-   `docs/03-project-structure.md`: A detailed explanation of the project's directory and file structure.
-   `docs/04-architecture.md`: An overview of the application's architecture, including key design patterns and principles.
-   `docs/05-state-management.md`: A guide to the application's state management using Redux Toolkit, including store setup, slices, and async logic.
-   `docs/06-components.md`: Documentation for all reusable UI components, including their props, usage examples, and testing information.
-   `docs/07-screens.md`: Documentation for each screen in the application, describing its purpose, the components it uses, and its role in the user flow.
-   `docs/08-testing.md`: Information on the testing strategy, including how to run unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
-   `docs/09-dependencies.md`: A list of the main project dependencies and their roles.
-   `docs/10-contribution-guide.md`: Guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards and the pull request process.
-   `docs/README.md`: The main entry point for the documentation, with links to all other sections.

## 2. Documentation Content Strategy

### 2.1. Introduction
-   Project vision and goals.
-   Key features.
-   Technology stack overview.

### 2.2. Getting Started
-   Prerequisites (Node.js, npm/yarn).
-   Cloning the repository.
-   Installing dependencies (`npm install`).
-   Running the development server (`npm run dev`).
-   Environment variables setup.

### 2.3. Project Structure
-   Detailed breakdown of the `frontend/src` directory.
-   Purpose of `components`, `screens`, `store`, `assets`, `test`, etc.
-   Naming conventions for files and folders.

### 2.4. Architecture
-   Component-based architecture.
-   Data flow (e.g., unidirectional data flow with Redux).
-   Folder structure conventions.
-   Styling approach (e.g., Tailwind CSS).

### 2.5. State Management
-   Redux store configuration (`store/index.ts`).
-   Structure of a Redux slice (`store/slices/`).
-   How to create new slices and actions.
-   Usage of selectors to access state.

### 2.6. Components
-   For each component in `src/components/`:
    -   A brief description of its purpose.
    -   A table of its `props` (name, type, default, description).
    -   Code snippets showing usage examples.
    -   Link to its test file.

### 2.7. Screens
-   For each screen in `src/screens/`:
    -   A description of the screen's purpose and user flow.
    -   A list of components used on the screen.
    -   State management interactions (which slices it uses).

### 2.8. Testing
-   Overview of the testing stack (e.g., Vitest, React Testing Library).
-   How to run tests (`npm test`).
-   How to view test coverage (`npm run coverage`).
-   Guidelines for writing new tests.

### 2.9. Dependencies
-   List of primary dependencies from `package.json`.
-   Brief explanation of why each dependency is used.

### 2.10. Contribution Guide
-   Coding style (ESLint rules).
-   Branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow).
-   Pull Request process.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  Create the `docs/` directory.
2.  Create the individual Markdown files as outlined above.
3.  Begin populating the content for each section, starting with `01-introduction.md` and `02-getting-started.md`.
4.  Systematically document each component, screen, and store slice.
5.  Review and refine the documentation for clarity and accuracy.
